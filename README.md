 ## **Grogu's starving and you're his only hope!!** 
  
 **In a galaxy far far away...** 
  
  
 The child, Grogu, is aboard a ship with the Frog Lady and her jar of delicious eggs. He's not meant to eat them, but they taste so good! 
  
  
 Can you grab as many eggs as you can from the jar, when the Frog lady isn't looking?  
 Be careful, or she'll catch you! 
 If you're really smart, you might even get to see your elusive protector, the Mandalorian.  
 But he's not keen on you eating those eggs, either, so that's double trouble!

**Introduction**
<br>
<br>
**This is a README for a game designed by Hackathon:Team_3, also known by some in the galaxy as "the-Resistance**  
<br>
The brief was to create, design and code a game with the Star Wars theme for the Code Institute's May 2023 Hackathon. Our game, called 'Eggstremely', is based on events that take place in episode 2 of season 2 of The Mandalorian (a Star Wars series aired by the Disney+)
<br>
<br>

**Submission**: 15.00pm on Monday the 15th of May 2023.
